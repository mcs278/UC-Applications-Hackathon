Hello,
please open our demo using google chrome.

Just some illustrations about our demo:
	(1) In our demo we are representing the change in the number of applications in the all 9 UC universities in california from 2007 to 2017 using cubes that rotate faster or slower as we go through the years depending on whether their application numbers increased or decreased respectively with respect to the previous years.
	(2) The demo starts from 2007 then u can either scroll the SLIDER located under the canvas to the right to get to the following years or you can just use the RIGHT ARROW key in the keyboard to go one more year per key press.
	(3)The cubes are ordered in the same order as the buttons located under the canvas
	(4)Moreover, if you click on the bottom that has the name of the university once, the cube that corresponds to that university will POP OUT. If you click a second time the cube will go back to its original position.

Thank you for reading this,
Enjoy the demo
